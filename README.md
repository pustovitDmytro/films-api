# films-api
NodeJs API as assignment to enter webbylab

## How to Install:
To install and launch project run this command in console:
```
yarn start
```
That should start App on localhost:8080.

If you want to use live-reloading, run:
```
yarn dev
```
## Front

I also provide client [app](https://github.com/pustovitDmytro/films) (React/Redux SPA) to show how to use this api.
